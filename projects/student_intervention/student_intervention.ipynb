    "* Naive Bayes has been successfully used in many applications including text classification [1]\n",
    "* Major strength is that the model requires realtively fewer training points. As the Naive assumes independence of features, the class conditional feature distribution can be decoupled. This leads to alleviate problem of \"curse of dimentionality\" and hence works well with smaller datasets [2]\n",
    "* Naive Bayes assume independence of features, which is often a strong assumption to make and if often inaccuarate in real world. The models where the there is a strong dependence of features, this model does not perform well. The features have to be carefully examined to avoid such dependences. \n",
    "* The reason for picking this model as a candidate is that the dataset provided for the problem is quite small and most of the features appear independent. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Gradient Boosting ##### \n",
    "* Gradient Boosting is a used in field of \"learning to rank\". It is used in commercial web engines.[3]\n",
    "* Gradient Boosting belongs to family of machine learning algorithms called Ensemble learning. These algorithms outperform other simpler algorithms as they are built upon multiple such simpler models. Gradient boosting has been shown to out perform other ensemble algorithms like Random Forest when tuned appropriately [4].\n",
    "* Gradient Boosting can overfit quite easily and appropriate tuning is required for its parameters specially depth of trees. Also, the Gradient boost requires that the trees are constructed sequentially as compared to random Forest which can build trees in parallel.[5]\n",
    "* Reason for picking GB for this problem is that the dataset is small and hence overfitting and large time to construct is of lesser issue than getting good result. GB have shown to outperform other ensemble methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. K-nearest neighbours ##### \n",
    "* KNN is used commonly in recommender systems and is even used in face recognition systems[6]. It is also used in computaional genetic applications [7]\n",
    "* KNN does not have a preprocessing step of \"training\" before making predictions. This is specifically useful when the data is large and prediction is required for small set of values. Its quite resilient to noise.[8]\n",
    "* Performance of KNN and its computational cost is dependent on the hyperparameter k. Its very important to get appropriate value to get better results (changing K can change predicted class for a point). Another decision is to define the distance function between different data points in dataset.\n",
    "* Based on the results of plotting various attributes vs each other (Experiments.ipynp), the classes seemed to have big local clusters separable by non-linear boundaries. I suspect local information for predicting class will give good results here.\n",

Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
